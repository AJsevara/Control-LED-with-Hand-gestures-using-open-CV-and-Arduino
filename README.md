# Control LED with Hand Gestures using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Arduino

This project enables controlling an LED using hand gestures by combining computer vision (OpenCV and Mediapipe) with Arduino hardware. The system detects specific gestures to control the LED, allowing it to turn on, off, or perform other actions based on recognized hand movements.
